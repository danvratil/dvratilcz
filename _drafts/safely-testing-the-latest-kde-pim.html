<p>Do you want to see if your problem in KDE PIM has been already fixed? Do you want to help the KDE PIM developers to spot bugs and regressions early in the development cycle before they get into a stable release? You can do all of this and more without affecting your stable KDE PIM installation, keeping your emails safe and sound :)</p>
<p>Thanks to Aleix's work on Flatpak in KDE, we have a manifest (or a recipe, if you will) to build a Kontact Flatpak from latest source code with just a few commands.</p>
<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to get and build any application on the <a href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Flatpak">Flatpak KDE wiki</a>.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have the KDE runtime installed:</p>
<pre>flatpak remote-add kderuntime --from http://distribute.kde.org/kderuntime.flatpakrepo
flatpak install kderuntime org.kde.Platform//5.9
flatpak install kderuntime org.kde.Sdk//5.9</pre>
<p>Then clone the repository with recipes for various KDE applications, and build Kontact:</p>
<pre>git clone anongit.kde.org/flatpak-kde-applications.git
cd flatpak-kde-applications
mkdir app repo
flatpak-builder --ccache --repo<span class="o">=</span>repo --subject<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"Build of Kontact `date`"</span> app org.kde.kontact.json</pre>
<p>Now go make a coffee. This is going to take a while.</p>
<p>Finally, add the local "repo" with the Kontact build to Flatpak and install Kontact from it:</p>
<pre>flatpak remote-add kontact-repo repo --no-gpg-verify
flatpak install kontact-repo org.kde.kontact
</pre>
<p>You can re-run the <code>flatpak-builder</code> command followed by <code>flatpak update</code> whenever you want to update the Flatpak to the latest development version.</p>

<p>PS: the <a href="https://survey.kde.org/index.php/852475?lang=en">KMail User Survey is still open</a>. If you haven't filled it yet, please do so to help us focus our future development or KDE PIM.</p>
