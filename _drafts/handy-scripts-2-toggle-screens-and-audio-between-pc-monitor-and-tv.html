<p>I have my main computer connected to my TV via HDMI and I'd like to be able to easily switch between my monitor and the TV - for instance when I want to watch a movie or play games from my couch. This is rather simple and can be done with a single xrandr command. The more tricky part however is how to toggle sound. When I switch my screen to TV I also want all audio to go through HDMI and play from the TV speakers, or to play via my external sound card when the PC screen is on.</p>
