<p>This semester I attended<em> Advanced Topics of Linux Administration</em> course on my university. To successfully complete the course, one must pass an exam, have a presentation and write an article on a related topic. I had a presentation about <a title="Libvirt homepage" href="http://libvirt.org/" target="_blank">libvirt</a> and decided to write an introduction into using libvirt's API (the article has been <a title="ATOL - Libvirt API" href="http://www.abclinuxu.cz/blog/Atol/2012/6/atol-libvirt-api" target="_blank">published</a> (in English) on Czech Linux portal ABCLinuxu.cz).</p>
<p>As an example, I have written a Plasma Applet in QML (yay, my first QML thingie!) and a Plasma DataEngine that serves data about QEMU/KVM virtual machines running under local libvirtd.</p>
<p>On the applet you can watch state of all virtual machines, you can boot/pause/resume/shutdown and reboot them and configure soft and hard memory limits and amount of virtual CPUs allocated to each machine.</p>

<p>I must admit that I was always a bit skeptical about QML, but my two previous encounters with QML made me really curious about it and writing this applet was really <del>pain</del><strong>fun</strong> and it taught me a lot about QML.</p>
<p>The big advantage of the DataEngine is that it's not constantly polling libvirt for changes, but it rather utilizes it's events API.</p>
<p>Wanna try? :-) There's a tarball <a href="http://kde-apps.org/CONTENT/content-files/151919-plasma-virt-monitor.tar.xz">here</a> and git repo here: git://anongit.kde.org/scratch/dvratil/plasma-virt-monitor</p>
<p>It was fun to hack and I plan to give it some more love, possibly after Akademy.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Akademy - anyone flying on Friday at 08:10 from Vienna :-) ?</p>
