<p>If you can't synchronize a folder in KMail and you are seeing "<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338658"><em>Multiple Merge Candidates</em></a>" error after the synchronization fails, here's a how to fix the folder to make it synchronize again - basically you force KMail to forget and re-sync the folder again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignright small" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/x1-275x300.png" alt="" width="275" height="300" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Akonadi Console.</li>
<li>Go to the <em>Browser</em> tab.</li>
<li>Right-click the broken folder and select "<em>Clear Akonadi Cache</em>" - this will remove all emails from the folder in Akonadi. This will <strong>NOT</strong> delete your emails on the server.</li>
<li>Akonadi Console will freeze for a while, wait until it unfreezes (sorry, it's just a developer tool, we don't have a very good UX there :-)).</li>
<li>Logout and login to make sure all PIM components are restarted.</li>
</ol>

<p>After login start KMail (or Kontact) and hit "<em>Check mail</em>". KMail will now re-download all emails from the previously broken folder. This may take a while depending on how large the folder is and how fast your internet connection is. After that the synchronization should work as expected.</p>

<p>In the upcoming KDE Applications 16.12.1 release Akonadi will have a fix that fixes the reason why the "<em>Multiple Merge Candidates</em>" error occurs, so hopefully in the future you should not see this error anymore.</p>
