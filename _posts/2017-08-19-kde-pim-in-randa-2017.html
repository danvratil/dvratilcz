<p>Randa Meetings is an annual meeting of KDE developers in a small village in Swiss Alps. The Randa Meetings is the most productive event I ever attended (since there's nothing much else to do but hack from morning until night and eat Mario's chocolate :-)) and it's very focused - this year main topic is making KDE more accessible.</p>
<p>Several KDE PIM developers will be present as well - and while we will certainly want to hear other's input regarding accessibility of Kontact, our main goal in Randa<span style="font-size: 16px;"> will be to port away from KDateTime (the KDE4 way of handling date and time in software) to QDateTime (the Qt way of handling date and time). This does not sound very interesting, but it's a very important step for us, as afterward, we will finally be free of all legacy KDE4 code. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">It is no simple task, but we are confident we can finish the port during the hackfest. If everything goes smoothly, we might even have time for some more cool improvements and fixes in Kontact ;-)</span></p>
<p>I will also close the <a href="https://survey.kde.org/index.php/852475?lang=en">KMail User Survey</a> right before the Randa meetings so that we can go over the results and analyze them. So, if you haven't answered the KMail User Survey yet, <a href="https://survey.kde.org/index.php/852475?lang=en">please do so</a> now and help spread the word! There are still 3 more weeks left to collect as many answers as possible. After Randa, I will be posting a series of blog posts regarding results of the survey.</p>
<p>And finally, please support the Randa Meetings by <a href="https://www.kde.org/fundraisers/randameetings2017/">contributing to our fundraiser</a> - the hackfest can only happen thanks to your support!</p>
