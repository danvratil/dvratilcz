<p>It's here! Plasma 5.2 has been released just yesterday and you don't have to wait a single minute longer to update your beloved Fedora boxes :-)</p>
<p>I won't go into detail here about all the new <em>awesome</em> things that are waiting for you in Plasma 5.2, but I totally recommend that you go and read <a title="Plasma 5.2 - The Quintessential Breakdown" href="https://kver.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/plasma-5-2-the-quintissential-breakdown/">Plasma 5.2: The Quintessential Breakdown</a> by Ken Vermette while you are waiting for your package manager to wade through the update. You can also read the official <a title="Plasma 5.2 - Beautiful and Featureful" href="https://dot.kde.org/2015/01/27/plasma-52-beautiful-and-featureful">Plasma 5.2 release announcement</a>, it has fancy animated screenshots ;).</p>
<p>And there's other news related to Plasma 5.2 and Fedora: Fedora rawhide has bee updated to Plasma 5.2 too. This means that KDE SIG will ship <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Plasma_5">Plasma 5 in Fedora 22</a>! Of course we will still maintain the Copr repository for our Fedora 20 and Fedora 21 users.</p>
<p>So, how to get Plasma 5.2 on Fedora?</p>
<p>On rawhide, just do <code>dnf update</code>. On Fedora 20 and Fedora 21, if you are already running Plasma 5.1.2 from <a href="http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5/">dvratil/plasma-5</a> Copr, then all you need to do is to run <code>dnf update.</code> If you are running Plasma 5.1.95 (aka Plasma 5.2 beta) from <code>dvratil/plasma-5-beta</code> Copr, then it's time to switch back to stable:</p>
<pre>dnf copr disable dvratil/plasma-5-beta
dnf copr enable dvratil/plasma-5
dnf update</pre>
<p>If you are still running KDE 4 and you want to update to Plasma 5.2, just follow the instructions on <a href="http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5/">dvratil/plasma-5</a> Copr page.</p>
<p>And if you don't feel like installing Plasma 5 on your production box right away and would like to just try it out, <a href="http://pub.dvratil.cz/plasma/iso/5.2.0">there's a live ISO for you</a>. This time I did <em>not </em>forget to add Anaconda, so once you decide that Plasma 5 is good enough for you, you can just install it right from the ISO ;-)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>I might have included Anaconda, but did not add grub2 to the ISO, so the installer would fail anyway. This has been fixed and updated images are available now on the same link. If you are planning to install from the live ISO, please download the updated images <em>(29-Jan-2015 00:42)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone is around in Brno next week for <a href="http://www.devconf.cz">DevConf</a>, let us know and we can informally meet for ceremonious consumption of beer to celebrate the Plasma release ;)</p>
