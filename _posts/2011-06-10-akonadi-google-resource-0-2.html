<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">so it's been almost ten days since first version of Akonadi Google Resource and now here comes 0.2. This version introduces Google Calendar Resource, so that you can finally access Google Calendar from comfortable interface of KOrganizer.</p>
<p><a href="{% post_url 2011-06-10-akonadi-google-resource-0-2 %}">UPDATE</a>: Akonadi Google Resource is now in KDE git repository!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Preview of Google Calendar Resource settings dialog" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ag_cal_settings-272x300.png" alt="Preview of Google Calendar Resource settings dialog" width="272" height="300" />As of now the resource supports read-only access to calendars, so you can just watch your busy schedule, but you still have to update it in GMail. Some basic write support is the main goal for version 0.3.<br />
A good news is, that the resource supports multiple calendars, so you can finally see all your calendars in KOrganizer, not just the default one. You have to add a new resource for each calendar you want to access. In configuration dialog you can then choose, which calendar you want to sync with.<br />
The resource supports, except for the basic properties, multiple attendees, including their roles and types, recurrent events (but without exceptions) and reminders (popup-dialog and email notification).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I already said, in 0.3 I'd like to introduce read-write access to Google Calendar and add photo-fetching to the Contacts resource.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><del>If you want to give it a try, you can download 0.2 tarball from <a title="Akonadi Google 0.2 sources" href="https://gitorious.org/akonadi-google/akonadi-google/archive-tarball/0.2">here</a>, or you get the most recent sources from git:</del></p>
