<p>While <a title="Evolution meets WebKit" href="{% post_url 2012-03-28-evolution-meets-webkit %}">porting  Evolution to WebKit</a>, I have made some major changes in how formatting emails in Evo works. But lately I've been more and more aware, that it's not flexible enough and that there is a lot of space for improvement.</p>
<p>With Milan Crha we designed a proper, object-oriented (within the limits of C and GLib) parser and formatter. They are now both very flexible, easily extensible and displaying e-mails is a bit faster thanks to more asynchronous approach.</p>

<p>The main feature that comes out of this redesign is an extension we call text-highlighter. It uses the <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/zip/download.html">highlight</a> utility to format text parts. For now we only highlight diffs and patches, but the list can easily be extended by all formats supported by <code>highlight</code>.</p>
<p>But we intend to go a bit further. We want to allow users to choose how each part should be formatted! The popup menu on each part of the email will contain a list of available (and compatible) formatters. Selecting one will reload the given part (each parts is in an &lt;iframe&gt; ) and render it again using specified formatter.</p>
<table border="0">

<tr>
<td><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/evo-formatting-1.png"><img class="tiny aligncenter" title="Example of the context menu with available formats" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/evo-formatting-1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></td>
<td><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/evo-formatting-2.png"><img class="tiny aligncenter" title="Evolution will format the part using selected formatter" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/evo-formatting-2-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As far as I can tell this is a quite unique feature among e-mail clients  and hopefully it will make lives of our users a bit easier :). This particular feature is not in place yet, but it will included in Evolution 3.6.</p>
<p>Now I'll spend a week or so by fixing regressions that we missed during testing (quite thorough, as always when Milan tests someting :D ) and that will appear when more people start using it, After that I'll finally move over to porting the message composer to WebKit.</p>
<p>Stay tuned ;)</p>
