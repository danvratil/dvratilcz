Plasma Pass, a [Plasma applet for the Pass password manager][plasmapass] version 1.2.0 is out.

The applet now supports OTP codes (in the format supported by the [pass OTP plugin][passotp]).
The 'clock' icon appears next to all passwords, even those that do not have OTP code. This
is a limitation caused by the passwords being stored in files encrypted and being decrypted
only when the user requests it - so the applet cannot know whether there's an OTP code
available in the password file until you click on it. There were also some small fixups
and UI improvements.
