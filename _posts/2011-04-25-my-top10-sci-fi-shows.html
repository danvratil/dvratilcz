<p style="text-align: justify;">As maybe not mentioned anywhere in this blog, I'm also a big fan of scifi series. I've been to <a href="http://www.festivalfantazie.cz">Festival Fantazie</a>, first in summer 2010, then again in autumn. By that time I've already seen some series, but it really encouraged me to see more. I was talking about publishing my top-scifi chart and to-see list, so finally here it comes.<!--more--></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Seen series</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I created the list of following shows, so the best (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">for me</span>) series are on the top. As time goes, I'll be updating this post, moving series from to-see to this list.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Babylon 5</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><del>I haven't seen the last two seasons yet, but I can already place Babylon 5 on the second place.</del> First place be it! In many aspects it's better then FarScape, but on the other hand, it lacks the proper kind of humor and universe I was used to from FarScape (I've seen FS just before B5). First I was afraid that I won't like all the talking and politics involved, but actually that's the thing which keeps me at the series. And Sheridan, of course :) There's nothing our brave captain couldn't solve. I'm looking forward to see the last two series in hope, that Ivanova will get more space, becuase I think she's absolutely amazing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Update 2011-04-25: So I've finished B5 last week. I really missed Ivanova in season 5, but the more happy I was when she appeared in the last episode. The final two parts were really moving and really awesome. B5 is now my #1 show. I'll really miss the guys.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. FarScape</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to explain this a little. I knew both Ben Browder and Claudia Black from SG-1, but I was really surprised. Crichton is <strong>much</strong> better written then Mitchell, and Aeryn is absolutely something different then Vala. First season was somehow boring, it really didn't took me in. But with Scorpius entering the show on full-time I just become to love the series. I've seen seasons 3 and 4 within one month (which is actually quite a short time for me!). The Peacekeeper Wars miniseries were very very good and led to a very good final, but for me, personally, the best final ever has BSG. Also, FarScape has absolutely the best Universe I've seen in scifi series.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Doctor Who 2005</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey, Tennant is my Doctor! When I finally became to like The Ninth Doctor, he just changed and David came in. It took me about two episodes to get used to him and I become to love him soon. He's the best, ever will be. Smith is barely adequate follower for Tennant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea of the entire Doctor is simply brilliant, they couldn't have made it better. There are only two big fails in the Doctor: Moffat and Smith. I don't like Karen either, but at least she's pretty :) Talking about companions, Rose is the best one for me. I don't think that Moffat is a bad writer and Smith bad actor, no. They're both very good, I just don't like their new style of Doctor. Well, let's see how it will change in season 6 this year, otherwise I'll have them all exterminated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Update: season 6 was...hmm...avarage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. BattleStar Gallactica</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">BSG was my first really-scifi (SG-1 does not count). Second season was absolutely the best, I've seen it in one day, I just couldn't stop. The third season, on the other hand, was the worst - just boring. It was not bad, but it just didn't have the action and speed of the previous season. It is a very very good show, and the final is simply the best I've ever seen (yet). Strong, well done and absolutely unexpected. My favourite characters were admiral Adama, Kara and Chief. Unfortunatelly Kara and Cheif changed a lot and at the end their characters were, at least weird.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5. Firefly</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Firefly! It will run for years...well it didn't because of the idiots in Fox, but still, it is a great show. It is very original - western scifi, duh! Nathan is a great actor and made watching the series a great fun for me. And I HAVE to mention Morena too. I've seen her in two or three episodes of V (haven't seen more yet) too and she's still so damned hot!! :) It's quite short, you can see it over night (or three nigths, like me) and it is definetely a must-see. And there's one more reason to see FireFly, and that's Jewel Staite and her smile.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6. Torchwood</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say TORCH, you say WOOD! This Doctor Who spin-off is a great for relaxation. It's very lamer but that's what make it so fraking awesome. I was quite surprised actually that a british thinkg can contain so lot of homosexuality, but it's the best they could've done. Harkness, being all-sexual, giving it with everyone and  everything..duh! Torchwood is so great because it's so lame - simply as that. If you don't have nothing else to do or see, you definetely go for this. I'm just little worried about the fourth season, which was shot in US.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Update: season 4 was cool - Gwen with bazooka? Go Torchwood, go!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7. Stargate SG-1</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stargate is a greate phenomenon, but in total, it's a nonsense. How it comes that everyone in the entire universe speaks English :)? It's very long and I really liked only the first five or so series. Oris could've been a good revival for the series, but unfortunatelly it was cut too soon. SG-1 is important for me in one way: it was the first sci-fi series I really begun to watch. And I don't regret it, because it moved me further, to BSG.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">8. Stargate Atlantis</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New, fresh and good idea, acutally a spin-off from one of the storylines of SG-1. Torri Higginson is a great leader (and actress of course!), and I really missed her in the fourth and fifth season. It's not the best scifi ever, but it's something worth seeing. But only when you've seen all the other series.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">9. Startgate Universe (season 1)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet another SG spin-off. The only SG-related thing is the gate, but there it ends. It's not bad - they've met aliens and they have secrets (especially Rush). I've seen few episodes from the second season and it seems to be good, I'll know more when I see all. The first season was very unbalanced I think. There were very very bad episodes, followed by two or three weeks long pause and the came two abso-freakin-lutely awesome episodes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">10. Red Dwarf (I really must see it again)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Red Dwarf is not 10th because I wouldn't consider it a good (good? Awesome!) series, but because it's much more sitcom then sci-fi and because it's a long time I've seen it and I really must find some time to see it again. Jokes and quotes are simply legen-wait for it-dary!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">To see</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">So here comes the the "to-see" list of scifi series:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li>Star Trek</li>
<li>Caprica</li>
<li>Stargate Universe, season 2</li>
<li>Pioneer One (soon as there will be more episodes)</li>
<li>Red Dwarf</li>
<li>V</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The order is random, just as I recalled the shows. What I can say now is, that I will probably give V second chance when I'm finished with Babylon 5, followed by Caprica and SGU S02.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope I didn't forget any series. I will try to return to this as soon as something changes. For now, I think it's quite enough :)</p>
