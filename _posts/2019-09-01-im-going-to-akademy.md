![I'm Going to Akademy!][banner]{:width="720px"}

In just five days I'll be on my way to [Akademy][akademy]! I'm so excited to meet with all my
friends from KDE! After missing the conference weekends in Almer√≠a and Vienna, I'll
be able to get the full Akademy experience again - including delivering a talk!

## Build Expressive APIs with Modern C++

I'll be giving [a talk][talk] about how to use some cool features from C++17 (even if you
cannot use C++17!) in your code to make it easier for others (and yourself) to
understand the intentions of the code, which helps improve productivity and reduce
bugs and errors. The talk will be on Sunday at 14:35 in room U4-08.

## KDE PIM BoF

The KDE PIM team will have [a BoF session][bof] on Monday morning (10:30 - 12:30) in room U1-04.
If you want to talk to us about anything KDE PIM related, feel free to stop by!

Other than that my main intention is to make use of the whole week to do some intensive
hacking on Akonadi, in-person debugging and fixing bugs :)

See you all in Milan!
