<p>If you want to know what we did in KDE PIM in the last year and what we are planning to do and achieve in the next one come to my <a href="https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/events/365">KDE PIM Status Report talk</a> on Sunday at 1 PM. If you want to get into more technical details and discussions about KDE PIM there will also be a <a href="https://community.kde.org/Akademy/2016/Monday#MAR_0.003_-_5th_September">KDE PIM BoF session</a> on Monday afternoon.</p>
