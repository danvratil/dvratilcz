<p>What am I going to do there? I will give a short talk on Saturday at 11:35 about what we have achieved in <a href="https://conf.kde.org/en/Akademy2014/public/events/107">Akonadi in the past year</a> and I'll be attending the KDE PIM BoF on Tuesday morning - you are all invited of course to join us in discussions about the future of KDE PIM! Possibly I'll also go to KTp BoF (purely for nostalgic reasons) and Solid BoF (did someone mention KScreen?).</p>
<p>I tried to list some talks I want to attend, but as I was browsing <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2014/program">the program</a> I realized I want to attend all of them. Seriously! So many interesting talks and so many things to learn this year! Any progress on the self-duplicating technology, so I could attend two talks at the same time? :-)</p>
<p>I'm really excited about this year Akademy. For us in Brno the Akademy has already begun in a sense with all the planing and preparations, but the real Akademy starts when everyone is here. I'm really looking forward to meet with all my friends from KDE again!</p>
<p>By the way, if you arrive on Friday (or earlier), stop by at the brand new Red Hat office for the <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2014/pre-registration-event">pre-registration event</a>. Food, drinks and fun are guaranteed!</p>

<p>See you all in couple days! *hug*</p>
