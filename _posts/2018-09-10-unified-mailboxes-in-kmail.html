<p>Today KMail has gained a new cool feature that has been repeatedly requested in the User survey last year as well as on forums and social networks: Unified mailboxes.</p>
<p>Unified mailboxes offer not only a unified inbox - a single "Inbox" folder showing emails from inboxes of all your accounts, it also provides unified sent and drafts folders by default. But we did not stop there: you can create completely custom unified mailboxes consisting of any folders you choose. You can even customize the default ones (for example exclude an Inbox from a particular account).</p>
<p>Some obligatory screenshots:</p>
<p>[gallery columns="2" ids="1005,1006"]</p>
<p>The feature will be present in the December release of KDE Applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you want to help us bring more cool features like this to Kontact?</em></strong></p>

They are simple mostly programming tasks that don't require any knowledge of Akonadi or all the complexities of Kontact. Feel free to pick any task from the list and reach out to us! We'll be happy to guide you. <a href="https://www.dvratil.cz/2018/08/kde-pim-junior-jobs-are-opened/">Read more here...</a></p>
