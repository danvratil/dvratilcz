Plasma 5.3, new feature release of KDE workspace, [has been released on Tuesday](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.3.0.php) and you can get it now on Fedora.

Plasma 5.3 brings new features, improvements and [almost 400 bug fixes](https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&chfield=resolution&chfieldfrom=2015-01-27&chfieldto=Now&known_name=AllPlasma&list_id=1243469&product=Breeze&product=kde-cli-tools&product=kde-gtk-config&product=kded-appmenu&product=kdeplasma-addons&product=khelpcenter&product=khotkeys&product=kinfocenter&product=kio-extras&product=klipper&product=kmenuedit&product=knetattach&product=krunner&product=ksmserver&product=ksplash&product=ksshaskpass&product=kstart&product=ksysguard&product=kwayland&product=kwin&product=kwrited&product=muon&product=Plasma%20Workspace%20Wallpapers&product=plasma-nm&product=plasmashell&product=Powerdevil&product=solid&product=systemsettings&query_based_on=AllPlasma&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED) for basically all of its components ranging from power management to various applets.

For users of Fedora 20 and Fedora 21 the traditional COPR repository has been updated. If you already use it just do yum update. If you want to switch to Plasma 5 from KDE 4 just [follow the instructions on the main page](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5/).

Fedora 22, which is currently in beta, already has the 5.3 update in updates-testing and we are continuously polishing the update. For all KDE users updating to Fedora 22, when it's released in May, it will also mean final bye bye to KDE 4 and switch to Plasma 5. Fedora 22 repositories also features the latest release of KDE Telepathy, which finally brings IM integration into Plasma 5.

If you want to try out Plasma 5.3 on Fedora but don't want to install it on your computer yet there's, as always, a [live ISO available](http://pub.dvratil.cz/plasma/iso/5.3.0/) for you based on Fedora 22 beta. And this time I *did* include a working installer (for real!), so when you change your mind just click "Install" ;-)

We welcome any feedback and testing from users, feel free to report any bugs to [bugzilla.redhat.com](https://bugzilla.redhat.com), talk to us on #fedora-kde IRC channel on Freenode or [join our mailing list](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/kde).
