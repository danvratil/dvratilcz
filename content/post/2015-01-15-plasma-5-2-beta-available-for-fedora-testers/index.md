On Tuesday [KDE has released first beta of the upcoming Plasma 5.2](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.1.95.php). Plasma 5.2 is adding many new features and improvements and we would welcome testers to help find and fix bugs before the final release.

Fedora users are welcome to try out Plasma 5.2 beta, either by running [Fedora Plasma 5.2 beta live ISO](http://pub.dvratil.cz/plasma/iso/5.1.95/) or by installing packages from [plasma-5-beta Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5-beta) (see *Installation Instructions* on the Copr page).

Check out the [release announcement](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.1.95.php) to see what new features and improvements are waiting for you in Plasma 5.2. Final release will be in two weeks on January 27, after that we will update the plasma-5 Copr to get the update to all our users :-)
