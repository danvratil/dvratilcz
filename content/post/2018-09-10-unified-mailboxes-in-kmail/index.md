title: Unified Mailboxes in KMail
---
Today KMail has gained a new cool feature that has been repeatedly requested in the User survey last year as well as on forums and social networks: Unified mailboxes.

Unified mailboxes offer not only a unified inbox - a single "Inbox" folder showing emails from inboxes of all your accounts, it also provides unified sent and drafts folders by default. But we did not stop there: you can create completely custom unified mailboxes consisting of any folders you choose. You can even customize the default ones (for example exclude an Inbox from a particular account).

Some obligatory screenshots:

The feature will be present in the December release of KDE Applications.
