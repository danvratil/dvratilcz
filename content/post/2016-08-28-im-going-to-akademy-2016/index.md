If you want to know what we did in KDE PIM in the last year and what we are planning to do and achieve in the next one come to my [KDE PIM Status Report talk](https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/events/365) on Sunday at 1 PM. If you want to get into more technical details and discussions about KDE PIM there will also be a [KDE PIM BoF session](https://community.kde.org/Akademy/2016/Monday#MAR_0.003_-_5th_September) on Monday afternoon.
