title: KDE Frameworks 5.3 and KDE Plasma 5.1 for Fedora are ready!
---

Fedora KDE SIG is happy to announce that latest version of KDE Frameworks 5 have just reached stable repositories of Fedora and brand new version of KDE Plasma 5 is now available in the [our Plasma 5 COPR](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5).

## KDE Frameworks 5.3.0

[The third release of KDE Frameworks](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.3.0.php) brings mostly bugfixes. KDE Frameworks 5 is a collection of libraries and software frameworks created by the KDE community. It's an effort to rework KDE 4 libraries into a set of individual and independent, cross platform modules that will be readily available to all Qt-based applications.

KDE Frameworks 5 are available in official Fedora repositories for Fedora 20 and the upcoming Fedora 21.

## KDE Plasma 5.1

KDE Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE workspace based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks. Its latest version brings many bug fixes, performance improvements but also many new features! Dark color theme for the Breeze style, more widgets, improved Task switcher, reworked tray icons and much more. You can read about all the new things in Plasma 5.1 in the [official release announcement](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.1/).

To install KDE Plasma 5 on Fedora, just add the [Plasma 5 COPR repository](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/dvratil/plasma-5/) to yum, and simply run `yum install plasma-5`.
