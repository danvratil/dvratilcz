Hi,

my name is Daniel Vrátil (dvratil) and I live in Prague, Czech republic. I work at [GEN Digital][gen] (previously known as [Avast Software][avast]) as a senior software engineer in a team responsible for various internal and public-facing backends, primarily in C++ and Rust. I also lead a small team of backend developers for a few years, focusing on C++ high performance backends. Previously I worked as a software engineer at [KDAB][kdab] and [Red Hat][redhat] (first as Evolution developer, then moved to work on KDE and Fedora packaging). [My CV][cv].

My main interest are my family, open source, free culture, software development, metal music and watching or reading science fiction. And beer - can't even get a profile picture without one :-)).

I'm a Linux geek, using ArchLinux and Fedora since around 2006. I've done some stuff in PHP, Gtk+ (C), C++, Qt and KDE and nowadays in Rust. I maintain various open-source projects, you can find the list of the most prominent ones on the main page, and have contributed to various parts of [KDE] for years.

You can find me on [Mastodon][mastodon], [Twitter][twitter], [GitHub][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin] and probably elsewhere too :)
