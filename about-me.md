Hi,

my name is Daniel Vrátil (dvratil) and I live in Prague, Czech republic. I work at [Avast Software][avast] as a senior software engineer, previously I worked  as software engineer at [KDAB](kdab) and [Red Hat](redhat) (first as Evolution developer, then moved to work on KDE and Fedora packaging). [My CV](cv).

My main interest are open source, free culture, software development, metal music and watching or reading science fiction. And beer (see the picture on the right - can't even get a profile picture without it :-)).

I'm a Linux geek, using ArchLinux and Fedora since around 2006. I've done some stuff in PHP, Gtk+ (C) and now I'm mostly doing C++, Qt and KDE. I'm a Qt Ambassador, KDE supporting member and KDE e.V. member, working mainly on KDE PIM.

Except for programming, I love scifi - Doctor Who, Babylon 5, Firefly, Firescape, Isac Asimov, H.G. Wells etc.), good beer (easy to get in Czech republic ;-)) and metal (hey, maybe we can meet on some Amon Amarth, Sabaton, Nigthwish or Epica gig!)...see [my profile][lastfm] on Last.fm. I also pretend to be a guitar player, attempting to play mostly covers from Amon Amarth, but I really suck.

You can find me on [Google+](gplus), [Facebook](fb), [Twitter](twitter) and [LinkedIn](linkedin) and probably elsewhere too :)

Oh, and if you want to make my inner whovian happy, you can buy me some [Doctor Who e-book on Amazon][amazon]{:title="Amazon Doctor Who Wish List"}.
