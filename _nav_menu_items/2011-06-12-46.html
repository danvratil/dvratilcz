<p>Hi, my name is Dan Vrátil, but on the Internet you can meet me as progdan. I was born in Teplice, Czech republic 20 years ago but currently I reside in Brno, where I study on Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University. My timetable. My main interest are computers, metal music and scifi movies and shows. I’m a Linux geek, using ArchLinux distribution since 2006. Together with my flatmate Michal Ruml we are developing custom websites in PHP. But more then PHP I like C++. I use it together with Qt framework to develop applications like TepSonic. My favourite metal genres are power metal, death and black metal. The first metal band I begun to listen to was Nighwish, later I discovered Sonata Arctica, Amon Amarth, Before the Dawn and many more. See my profile on Last.fm. I do play guitar too, mostly covers from Amon Amarth. I’m also scifi fan, my favourite serials are Doctor Who and Torchwood, further I’ve seen Farscape, Firefly, SG{-1,A,U}, TBBT and many more. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. More info to come :)</p>
